# Objectives

* Start using an issue tracker
* Start getting familiar with GitHub

# Steps

* Go to github.com and create your own free personal account
* Watch this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E
* Try it out! Go to our community repository and create your own issue https://github.com/acivitillo/python_data_products_workshop/issues


# Moving forward

* We'll get into the Python soon but keep using the issue tracker in GitHub. This will help you understand how collaboration works during data analytics and data science projects
