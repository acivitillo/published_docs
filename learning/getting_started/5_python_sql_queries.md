# Objectives

* Go on your own! Start querying the data and do intro pandas work

# Steps

There are not steps here, only questions based on the `Chinook.db` data.

### Simpler, 1 table

* What is the total value of all invoices?
* What is the value of invoice with id 404?
* How many employees do we have?
* How many artists do we have?

### More complex, requires SQL joins

* What are our top 10 customers?
* What tracks are selling the most?
* Who purchased invoice with id 404?

# Moving forward

* Continue to work with the `Chinook.db` data, ask questions on the issue tracker if you want more work to do
* Add visualizations using either Pandas or Python Altair
* Find something in your work that can be improved with Python
