**Remember** start always simple and then build on top. Do some quick bar charts, line charts, etc., then you can apply yourself to more complex scenarios.

# Objectives

* Create a Python notebook to analyze CO2 emissions
* Compare CO2 growth with potential counter CO2 measures like CO2 capture technologies, CO2 tax, CO2 reductions

# Questions

As you build this notebook you can use the below questions as a *guideline*. Note this is just to give you ideas, not asking you to do exactly this.

* What it is the CO2 development worldwide since 1900?
* What are the CO2 emissions by industry? (i.e. air travel, transportation, farming, etc.)
* What are the high potential CO2 reduction activities? Maybe show this in a chart

You think there should be other questions too? Edit this page to add your questions and send me a PR!
