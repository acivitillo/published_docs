**Remember** start always simple and then build on top

# Objectives

This repo could use some more documentation either in text format (.md files) or youtube videos. You can go over your experience as a beginner doing the exercises in `intro_workshop` and document the steps you found most difficult.

Think of it this way, by working on the documentation you will solidify your knowledge of git and python. Teaching is the best way of learning.
