**Remember** start always simple and then build on top. 

The Altair (https://altair-viz.github.io/) library is an amazing charting library based on Vega. Vega is a javascript library built with the concept of `grammar of graphics`. This concept is extremely powerful, it's like SQL for charting.

# Objectives

* Use the chinook database to build few business looking charts
* Do bar charts, line charts, etc
* See if you can create some interactive charts (https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html#interactive-charts)

# Advanced

* Instead of displaying the charts in a notebook, try to build a dashboard using Flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/). For this you will need an IDE like Atom or VSCode
